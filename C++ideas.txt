C++ idea to create a student record system kinds like sulis where if logged in as a tutor you can create assignments and submit scores for each student and logged in as a student can view these assignments etc. 

Have grades for each student and ability to calculate total grades etc. 

Manage all records for them etc.

Have an ability for a tutor to create a quiz and give each question a key for the correct answer e.g multiple choice. Then when student takes it , it automatically corrects it, adds the result to their gradebook and submit the answers and scores to the lecturer responsibile like sulis exams

A quiz class should hold all questions and answers, maybe a vector of Question objects and Question class could have the question and all possible choices plus correct one

Have ability to go back/forward/view (un)answered questions maybe a timer too

Maybe store quiz results and records in a database and have results folder with each folder holding different results for each student etc

maybe use c++ and mysql with connectors, you learned mysql before it should be easy:
	https://dev.mysql.com/doc/connector-cpp/8.0/en/
	
Have one class interface with this and have public methods as follows:
	add/removeStudent(name, age), or by id as it could be a primary key
	add/removeTutor (same as above)
	add/remove/editStudentGrade(exam id, grade, other params etc.)
	add/removeSubject/Course
	add/removeAssignment/Quiz
	getStudentMatching(params)
	getGradesAndIds for exam
	etc.
	
	more
this interface would hide the code to execute queries etc
