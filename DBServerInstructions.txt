These are instructions for connecting to the database server.

The database server is running on the Raspberry Pi (at time of writing hostname is 192.168.1.9, this could change, check the router login

To point the program to this server, enter for hostname 192.168.1.9

If you can't access the server, for testing you could create one locally on Ubuntu for example

It may be useful to save 192.168.1.9 in the /etc/hosts file as pi so you can type pi for host instead.

And if this ip was to change you could easily change the hosts file and the login file would still be fine
